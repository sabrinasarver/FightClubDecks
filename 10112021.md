> 	1.	write the docs your gonna give users for onboarding. Then get that directory sync running and the users imported and onboarding emails sent out so users start registering.
>	2.	Design and write policy
>	3.	Test as many integrations in trials/labs as possible (can be done concurrently with 1 and 2)
>	4.	Start transferring apps into Duo
>   waiting on users to get signed up often takes a while, so we want to get that process started as soon as we can, that way instead of waiting for people to read their email and click the link, get the app etc. We can be working on stuff while we are waiting for the user action
>   we can deploy into prod and skip the lab phase if you want, but that will depend on your confidence and risk tolerance
