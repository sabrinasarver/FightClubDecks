##Cisco Meraki Webinar: Taking a Proactive Approach to Security

[.column]
###The difference between proactive and reactive security:

  - **Reactive**
    An attack happens, and your team responds or reacts, to the breach. The attack is discovered, the attacker repelled, the damage is assessed, and the clean-up begins. There is nothing inherently wrong with reactive security this is part of the reason you've invested in security controls but this cannot be your entire security culture.
  - **Proactive**
    When your culture is proactive, your team is committed to prevention rather than simply to responding to threats. This means investing in a strong defensive position, educating your employees about good security practices, and planning for risks your organization hasn't yet encountered

[.column]

####Unified Access Control & Video Security
- **Efficiency**
  With an integrated system, all operations can become streamlined. Surveillance and access control information can be viewed from a single interface at a workstation or even on your smartphone with a simple app.
- **Real-Time Monitoring & Entry / Exit Validation**
  You can view access control information on the same interface as the video, rather than linking events and reports later.
- **Data Collection & Centralization**
  A centralized system allows for more actionable data collection, as well as improved security measures.
- **Improved Safety**
  You can also have alarms or a PA linked through the same system as video surveillance. Tailgating can be addressed immediately.
